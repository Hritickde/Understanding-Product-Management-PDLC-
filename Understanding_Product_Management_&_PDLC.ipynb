        "The product life cycle’s three stages—Introduction, Growth, and Maturity—can be defined succinctly. In the introduction stage, a product is launched with heavy marketing to generate awareness but initially low sales. The growth stage follows, with rapidly rising sales, expanding market share, and broader distribution as demand increases. Maturity occurs when sales plateau, the market becomes saturated, and competition intensifies. In India, the iPhone clearly falls in the growth stage. For example, Apple achieved record iPhone sales in 2024, shipping 12 million units (a 35% year-on-year increase), and its market share climbed to about 10%. Apple is also expanding its presence in India (e.g., opening retail stores and boosting local production). Growing demand for premium smartphones (driven by iPhone 15/13 models) further supports this trend. In fact, Apple’s India revenue grew 36% in FY2024 and its net profit rose ≈23%(accio.com), underscoring strong market momentum. These indicators of accelerating sales and expansion match the classic growth-stage profile, showing that the iPhone is currently in the growth stage in India.\n",
